bit_rot_detector
==========================

bit_rot_detector is a tool designed to crawl a directory tree, 
calculate fingerprints of all files it finds and compare them to a database
containing known-good fingerprints. It is intended to be part of a larger
file archiving/backup management project in the future, hence the choice of 
SQLite.
