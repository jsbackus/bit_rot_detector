simple_file_integrity_tool
==========================

simple_file_integrity_tool is a tool designed to crawl a directory tree, 
calculate fingerprints of all files it finds and compare them to a database
containing known-good fingerprints. It is intended to be part of a larger
"file archiving" project in the future, hence the choice of SQLite.
