-= check_files =-
* Should consider converting code to a class - global namespace doesn't work
  like expected.
* Calculating a fingerprint and looking a file up in the database should be run
  in parallel via threads.
* Add a 'file type' column (type INT) and a 'metadata index' column (type int).
  Intent is to store meta data for various file types in separate tables (one
  per file type) and use the 'metadata index' as the index into said table.
  -> Since SQLite supports adding columns, going to punt on this.
* Maybe have a 'roots' table that allows for aliasing? Need to cross w/
  parent_id field in dirs table.
* put FP calc in own thread
* put DB in own thread
* move all DB stuff to own functions (extricate from current functions)
* Added throw/try/catch so that KeyboardInterrupt stops for multiple roots!
* Create script to check for duplicates by fingerprint
* Need to add code to fingerprint db
* code to copy db to backup locations?
* code/script to compare databases?
* Add ability to only check files if the directory their in hasn't been checked
  recently.
  - make this optional
  - make the time configurable.
  - not doing for individual files to reduce db overhead.

-= Repo =-
* Need to tidy up TODO list!
* Write a decent README.
