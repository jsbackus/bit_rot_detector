* Should consider converting code to a class - global namespace doesn't work
  like expected.
* Calculating a fingerprint and looking a file up in the database should be run
  in parallel via threads.
* Add a 'file type' column (type INT) and a 'metadata index' column (type int).
  Intent is to store meta data for various file types in separate tables (one
  per file type) and use the 'metadata index' as the index into said table.
  -> Since SQLite supports adding columns, going to punt on this.
* Maybe have a 'roots' table that allows for aliasing? Need to cross w/
  parent_id field in dirs table.
* put FP calc in own thread
* put DB in own thread
* move all DB stuff to own functions (extricate from current functions)
* Added throw/try/catch so that KeyboardInterrupt stops for multiple roots!
* code to copy db to backup locations?
* code/script to compare databases?
* Add support for only scanning subtrees.
  - This will likely mean bringing the "roots" table back...

-= Repo =-
* Need to tidy up TODO list!
* Write a decent README.

* Deciphering targets:
  - allow user to specify root with --root
  - convert "." and ".." to actual name
  - get absolute path name
  - look base name up in:
    o files table first
    o directory table second
  - if any entries are found, generate tree until can resolve:
    o root id
    o parent id
  - for diff roots, start at root and descend into common children.
  - for dupe subtrees:
    o first, generate list of dir entries that have same name.
    o for each grouping, start comparing file names and optionally finger prints
      of contents. include child directories.
    o calculate a "likeness" metric for each item in each grouping
    o rebuild tree structure until likeness metric drops off
  - add ability to delete one or more roots.
    o first delete children
    o then delete relevant entries in roots table.
  - add ability to browse file structure.
