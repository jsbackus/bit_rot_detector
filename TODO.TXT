* Create script to check for duplicates by fingerprint
* finish processFile()
* write showHelp()
* Put on GitHub?
* Need to add code to fingerprint db
* code to copy db to backup locations?
* code/script to compare databases?

-= Convert to Python =-
* Look at hashlib for info on generating fingerprints
  http://docs.python.org/2/library/hashlib.html#module-hashlib
* Look at os.listdir() for info on getting directory listings.
* Definitely look at os.walk()!!
* Should consider converting code to a class - global namespace doesn't work
  like expected.
* Calculating a fingerprint and looking a file up in the database should be run
  in parallel via threads.
* Replace os.walk() with custom code:
  - Use a list as a stack of tuples containing the path name and the path id.
  - add and remove from end
  - Maybe write a generator?
* Consider using the SyPy table construct instead of database. Use MKVs and 
  backup disk for comparisons.
