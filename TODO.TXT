* Create script to check for duplicates by fingerprint
* finish processFile()
* write showHelp()
* Put on GitHub?
* Need to add code to fingerprint db
* code to copy db to backup locations?
* code/script to compare databases?

-= Convert to Python =-
* Look at hashlib for info on generating fingerprints
  http://docs.python.org/2/library/hashlib.html#module-hashlib
* Look at os.listdir() for info on getting directory listings.
* Definitely look at os.walk()!!
* Should consider converting code to a class - global namespace doesn't work
  like expected.
* Calculating a fingerprint and looking a file up in the database should be run
  in parallel via threads.
* Replace os.walk() with custom code:
  - Use a list as a stack of tuples containing the path name and the path id.
  - add and remove from end
  - Maybe write a generator?
* Consider using the SyPy table construct instead of database. Use MKVs and 
  backup disk for comparisons.
* Add a 'file type' column (type INT) and a 'metadata index' column (type int).
  Intent is to store meta data for various file types in separate tables (one
  per file type) and use the 'metadata index' as the index into said table.
* See if there is a way to limit number of chars in text fields.
* Maybe have a 'roots' table that allows for aliasing? Need to cross w/
  parent_id field in dirs table.

-= Repo =-
* Need to tidy up TODO list!
* Write a decent README.
